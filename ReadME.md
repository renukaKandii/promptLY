3. **Restart Chrome:**
   - Click the blue **"Relaunch"** button that appears at the bottom
   - Chrome will close and reopen

‚úÖ Flags enabled!

---

### Step 2: Check for window.ai API (Optional Check)

1. **Press F12** to open Developer Console

2. **Type and press Enter:**
   ```javascript
   window.ai
   ```

3. **What you see:**

   **If you see an object** like `{languageModel: ...}` ‚úÖ
   - Great! You have this API.
   - Download the model:
     ```javascript
     await ai.languageModel.create()
     ```
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for the ~2GB download
   - Skip to Step 4

   **If you see `undefined`**
   - Don't worry! This is normal (Google's gradual rollout process)
   - You can try Chrome Dev or Canary if you want this specific API
   - Or just **continue to Step 3** - the LanguageModel API works just as well!

---

### Step 3: Check for LanguageModel API (Main Method)

Most users will use this method:

1. **In the console, type:**
   ```javascript
   LanguageModel
   ```

2. **Expected result:**
   ```javascript
   ∆í LanguageModel() { [native code] }
   ```

3. **What this means:**

   ‚úÖ **If you see this function** - Perfect! AI is available. Continue below:
   
   ```javascript
   await LanguageModel.create({ output: { language: "en" } })
   ```
   
   - This downloads the ~2GB AI model
   - **Wait 5-10 minutes** for download to complete
   - Chrome might feel slow during download - this is normal
   
   ‚ùå **If you see "not defined"** - Something's wrong:
   - Make sure you're on Chrome 127+ (check `chrome://version`)
   - Go back to Step 1 and verify you enabled BOTH flags correctly
   - Make sure you clicked "Relaunch" and Chrome restarted
   - Close ALL Chrome windows completely and reopen
   - If still not working, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

---

### Step 4: Verify Model Downloaded

1. **Go to Chrome Components:**
   - Copy and paste: `chrome://components`

2. **Find "Optimization Guide On Device Model":**
   - Scroll through the list to find this component

3. **Check the version:**
   - **Version: 0.0.0.0** ‚Üí Still downloading, wait longer
   - **Version: 2024.xx.xx.xxxx** (has numbers) ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Downloaded and ready!**
   - **Not in the list** ‚Üí Download hasn't started yet, go back to Step 3

‚úÖ **Once you see a version with numbers, the AI model is ready!**

## ‚ö° Quick Prompts Explained

### üìù Simplify (ELI5)

**Purpose:** Make complex content accessible to everyone, even children

**Prompt:** "Explain this like I'm 5 years old, using simple everyday language that anyone can understand."

**Best for:**
- Technical documentation
- Scientific concepts
- Legal jargon
- Academic papers

**Example:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others.
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  Imagine you have two magic coins. No matter how far apart you put them, when you flip one and it lands on heads, the other one instantly lands on tails. They're connected in a magical way that scientists call "quantum entanglement." It's like the coins can talk to each other faster than anything in the universe!
  ```

---

### üìö Elaborate

**Purpose:** Expand brief notes into detailed, comprehensive explanations

**Prompt:** "Expand this with more details, context, and real-world examples to make it more comprehensive."

**Best for:**
- Bullet points ‚Üí full paragraphs
- Brief summaries ‚Üí detailed explanations
- Notes ‚Üí comprehensive reports
- Outlines ‚Üí fleshed-out content

**Example:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  AI improves healthcare.
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare across multiple dimensions. For instance, AI-powered diagnostic tools can analyze medical images like X-rays and MRIs with remarkable accuracy, often detecting conditions that human radiologists might miss. In drug discovery, AI algorithms can screen millions of molecular compounds in days rather than years, accelerating the development of new treatments. Additionally, AI chatbots provide 24/7 patient support, answering health questions and triaging symptoms before a doctor visit. These technologies not only improve patient outcomes but also reduce costs and increase access to quality care in underserved areas.
  ```

---

### ‚úâÔ∏è Reply to Email

**Purpose:** Draft professional email responses quickly and appropriately

**Prompt:** "Write my professional email reply to this message. I am responding to them, not the other way around. Keep a professional tone, thank them if appropriate, and respond to their key points naturally."

**Best for:**
- Job application responses
- Business correspondence
- Networking emails
- Customer service replies

**Important Note:** This works very reliably (~99% success rate), but occasionally the AI might misinterpret sender/recipient context in complex email threads. If the output addresses you instead of responding for you, simply click **‚ñ∂ Run** again or add an explicit custom instruction.

üí° **Pro Tip:** Hover over the "Reply to Email" card in promptLY to see a helpful tooltip about selecting the entire email (from greeting to signature) for best results!

**Example:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  Dear Sarah,

  Thank you for applying to the Senior Data Scientist position at TechCorp. We have reviewed your application and would like to invite you to a phone screening next week. Are you available Tuesday at 2 PM EST?

  Best regards,

- Auto-hides after 3 seconds to keep UI clean
- Top status bar only shows AI availability (doesn't change during operations)

**Output Clearing:**
- Previous output is cleared when clicking Run
- This is intentional to avoid confusion with stale content
- Use History feature to restore previous outputs

**Quick Prompt Tooltip:**
- Hover over "Reply to Email" card to see usage tips
- Suggests selecting entire email for best results

**History Limitations:**
- Limited to last 10 items (saves browser storage)
- No search or filter functionality
- Cleared when browser cache is cleared

**Visual Feedback:**
- Quick Prompt cards highlight with blue border when selected
- Selection persists until you click another card
- Cannot select multiple Quick Prompts simultaneously

## üîç FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is promptLY really free?**
A: Yes! No subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no ads. Completely free and open source.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Yes! After the initial model download (requires internet), all processing happens on your device offline. You only need internet once for setup.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: Currently English, Spanish (Espa√±ol), and Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û). More coming soon!

**Q: Can I use this for work/commercial purposes?**
A: Yes! MIT License allows commercial use. However, always review AI outputs for professional contexts.

---

### Setup & Technical Questions

**Q: Why do I need Chrome 127+?**
A: Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano) was introduced in version 127. Earlier versions don't have the necessary AI capabilities.

**Q: I get "ai is not defined" OR "LanguageModel is not defined". What's wrong?**
A: The flags aren't enabled correctly. Go back to Step 1, make sure you enabled BOTH flags with the exact options shown, click "Relaunch", then close ALL Chrome windows and reopen fresh.

**Q: How do I know if the AI model is ready?**
A: Check `chrome://components` and look for "Optimization Guide On Device Model". If the version shows numbers (not 0.0.0.0), it's ready!

**Q: I don't see "Optimization Guide On Device Model" in chrome://components**
A: Run `await LanguageModel.create({ output: { language: "en" } })` in console to trigger the download. Check components again after a few minutes.

**Q: Can I use this on Firefox/Safari/Edge?**
A: No. Chrome's built-in AI is Chrome-specific. Other browsers may add similar features in the future.

**Q: Why is the model download so large?**
A: Gemini Nano is a powerful AI model that runs entirely on your device. The ~2GB size is necessary for its capabilities.

**Q: Does window.ai or LanguageModel work?**
A: promptLY supports BOTH! It automatically detects which API is available on your Chrome and uses it. You don't need to worry about which one you have.

---

### Privacy Questions

**Q: Is my text sent to any servers?**
A: No! All processing happens locally on your device. Zero data leaves your machine.

**Q: Can my employer/school see what I'm transforming?**
A: No. Unlike cloud AI tools, promptLY doesn't send data anywhere, so there's no server logs to monitor.

**Q: Does Google see my prompts?**
A: No. Your text stays on your device. Google may collect anonymous usage statistics about the AI feature itself (not your content).

---

### Usage Questions

**Q: Why didn't "Reply to Email" work correctly?**
A: In rare cases (~1%), the AI may misinterpret sender/recipient. Try selecting the entire email (greeting to signature), click Run again, or add the explicit custom instruction shown in the tooltip.

**Q: Where do I see the tooltip for Reply to Email?**
A: Hover your mouse over the "Reply to Email" Quick Prompt card. A tooltip will appear with usage tips.

**Q: Where do status messages appear?**
A: Status messages appear in two places: (1) Top bar shows AI availability ("Ready", "Built-in AI"), and (2) Input header shows action feedback ("Generating...", "Done!", "Copied!") right where you're working.

**Q: Why is Custom Instructions hidden by default?**
A: To save vertical space so you can see the Run button without scrolling. It auto-expands when you click a Quick Prompt, or you can manually show it with the "+ Show Custom" button.

**Q: How do I export my history?**
A: Currently, history is browser-local only. Export feature is planned for future versions.

**Q: Can I customize the Quick Prompts?**
A: Not yet, but custom Quick Prompts are planned for a future update. For now, use Custom Instructions for your own prompts.

---

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: promptLY won't install. What do I do?**
A: Make sure you're using Chrome 127+ (check `chrome://version`), and that you've enabled Developer Mode in `chrome://extensions/`.

**Q: The extension shows "AI not available" or "local fallback"**
A: The AI model isn't downloaded yet. Go to `chrome://components`, find "Optimization Guide On Device Model", and click "Check for update". Or run `await LanguageModel.create({ output: { language: "en" } })` in console.

**Q: It says the model is downloading. How long does it take?**
A: Usually 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed. You can continue using Chrome normally during download.

**Q: Why is processing slow?**
A: Large texts or complex instructions take longer. Performance also depends on your device's CPU/RAM. Close other tabs to free up resources.

**Q: The Stop button doesn't immediately stop generation**
A: Chrome's AI APIs don't support mid-generation interruption. The Stop button signals to discard the result once generation completes (usually within seconds).

### AI Not Available

**Symptom:** Extension shows "AI not available - local mode" or you get errors in console

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Chrome version:**

3. **Verify API is available:**
   - Open console (F12)
   - Type: `LanguageModel`
   - Should see: `∆í LanguageModel() { [native code] }`
   - If "not defined" ‚Üí Flags didn't work, restart Chrome completely

4. **Download the model:**
