## ‚ö° Quick Prompts Explained

### üìù Simplify (ELI5)

**Purpose:** Make complex content accessible to everyone, even children

**Prompt:** "Explain this like I'm 5 years old, using simple everyday language that anyone can understand."

**Best for:**
- Technical documentation
- Scientific concepts
- Legal jargon
- Academic papers

**Example:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles interact in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others.
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  Imagine you have two magic coins. No matter how far apart you put them, when you flip one and it lands on heads, the other one instantly lands on tails. They're connected in a magical way that scientists call "quantum entanglement." It's like the coins can talk to each other faster than anything in the universe!
  ```

---

### üìö Elaborate

**Purpose:** Expand brief notes into detailed, comprehensive explanations

**Prompt:** "Expand this with more details, context, and real-world examples to make it more comprehensive."

**Best for:**
- Bullet points ‚Üí full paragraphs
- Brief summaries ‚Üí detailed explanations
- Notes ‚Üí comprehensive reports
- Outlines ‚Üí fleshed-out content

**Example:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  AI improves healthcare.
  ```
- **Output:** 
  ```
  Artificial Intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare across multiple dimensions. For instance, AI-powered diagnostic tools can analyze medical images like X-rays and MRIs with remarkable accuracy, often detecting conditions that human radiologists might miss. In drug discovery, AI algorithms can screen millions of molecular compounds in days rather than years, accelerating the development of new treatments. Additionally, AI chatbots provide 24/7 patient support, answering health questions and triaging symptoms before a doctor visit. These technologies not only improve patient outcomes but also reduce costs and increase access to quality care in underserved areas.
  ```

### ‚úâÔ∏è Reply to Email

**Purpose:** Draft professional email responses quickly and appropriately

**Prompt:** "Write my professional email reply to this message. I am responding to them, not the other way around. Keep a professional tone, thank them if appropriate, and respond to their key points naturally."

**Best for:**
- Job applications responses
- Business correspondence
- Networking emails
- Customer service replies

**Important Note:** This works very reliably (~99% success rate), but occasionally the AI might misinterpret sender/recipient context in complex email threads. If the output addresses you instead of responding for you, simply click **‚ñ∂ Run** again or add an explicit custom instruction like "I am replying to them."

**Example:**
- **Input:** 
  ```
  Dear Sarah,

  Thank you for applying to the Senior Data Scientist position at TechCorp. We have reviewed your application and would like to invite you to a phone screening next week. Are you available Tuesday at 2 PM EST?

  Best regards,
  Michael Chen
  Hiring Manager

- **Output:** 
  ```
  Dear Michael,

  Thank you for considering my application for the Senior Data Scientist position at TechCorp. I'm excited about the opportunity and would be happy to participate in a phone screening.

  Tuesday at 2 PM EST works perfectly for me. I'll make sure I'm available and prepared to discuss my experience and how I can contribute to the team.

  Looking forward to our conversation!

  Best regards,
  Sarah
  ```

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Browser & System Requirements

**Chrome Version:**
- ‚úÖ **Chrome Stable 127+** - Fully supported (current: 141+)
- ‚úÖ **Chrome Beta** - Fully supported
- ‚úÖ **Chrome Dev** - Fully supported  
- ‚úÖ **Chrome Canary** - Fully supported
- ‚ùå **Chrome 126 or older** - Built-in AI not available

**System Requirements:**
- **RAM:** Minimum 4GB, recommended 8GB+ (model runs in memory)
- **Storage:** ~2GB free space for Gemini Nano model
- **OS:** Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Linux (recent distributions)

### AI Model Limitations

**Model Download:**
- **Requires internet connection** for initial ~1.5-2GB model download
- Download happens automatically on first use
- Takes 5-10 minutes depending on internet speed
- **After download, works completely offline!**
- Progress can be checked in DevTools console

**Language Support:**
- Currently limited to English, Spanish, Japanese
- Output may default to English even when other languages selected (working on fix)

**Processing:**
- Cannot be interrupted mid-generation (Stop button waits for completion)
- Longer texts (>2000 words) may take 10-15 seconds
- Very complex custom instructions may produce unexpected results

### Email Reply Feature

**Success Rate: ~99%**

Occasionally (‚âà1% of cases) the AI may:
- Address you instead of the sender
- Misinterpret sender/recipient in complex email threads with multiple people
- Get confused by forwarded messages with nested quotes

**Workarounds:**
1. Click **‚ñ∂ Run** again (often works on second try)
2. Add explicit instruction: "I am replying to them, not the other way around"
3. Manually edit the generated output
4. Use Custom Instructions instead of Quick Prompt

**When it works best:**
- Simple 1-on-1 email threads
- Clear sender/recipient context

## üîç FAQ

### General

**Q: Is promptLY really free?**
A: Yes! No subscriptions, no in-app purchases, no ads. Completely free and open source.

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Yes! After the initial model download (requires internet), all processing happens on your device offline. You only need internet once for setup.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: Currently English, Spanish (Espa√±ol), and Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û). More coming soon!

### Technical

**Q: Why do I need Chrome 127+?**
A: Chrome's built-in AI (Gemini Nano) was introduced in version 127. Earlier versions don't have the necessary AI capabilities.

**Q: How do I know if the AI model is ready?**
A: Run `(await ai.languageModel.capabilities()).available` in DevTools console. If it returns `"readily"`, you're good!

**Q: Can I use this on Firefox/Safari/Edge?**
A: No. Chrome's built-in AI is Chrome-specific. Other browsers may add similar features in the future.

**Q: Why is the model download so large?**
A: Gemini Nano is a powerful AI model that runs entirely on your device. The ~2GB size is necessary for its capabilities.

### Privacy

**Q: Is my text sent to any servers?**
A: No! All processing happens locally on your device. Zero data leaves your machine.

**Q: Can my employer/school see what I'm transforming?**
A: No. Unlike cloud AI tools, promptLY doesn't send data anywhere, so there's no server logs to monitor.

**Q: Does Google/Anthropic see my prompts?**
A: No. Your text stays on your device. Only anonymous AI usage statistics may be collected by Chrome itself (not your content).

### Usage

**Q: Why didn't "Reply to Email" work correctly?**
A: In rare cases (~1%), the AI may misinterpret sender/recipient. Try clicking Run again or add explicit custom instruction.

**Q: Can I use this for work/commercial purposes?**
A: Yes! MIT License allows commercial use. However, always review AI outputs for professional contexts.

**Q: How do I export my history?**
A: Currently, history is browser-local only. Export feature is planned for future versions.

**Q: Can I customize Quick Prompts?**
A: Not yet, but custom Quick Prompts are planned for a future update. For now, use Custom Instructions.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: promptLY won't install. What do I do?**
A: Make sure you're using Chrome 127+ (check chrome://settings/help), and that you've enabled Developer Mode in `chrome://extensions/`.

**Q: The AI says "not available". How do I fix this?**
A: Check that you've enabled the correct flags and restarted Chrome. Run the verification command in DevTools.

**Q: It says "after-download". How long does download take?**
A: Usually 5-10 minutes depending on your internet speed. You can check progress in DevTools console.

**Q: Why is processing slow?**
A: Large texts or complex instructions take longer. Also depends on your device's CPU/RAM. Close other tabs to free up resources.
